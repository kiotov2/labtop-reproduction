# Small-scale MIMIC-IV configuration for CPU-friendly local experiments
# This config is designed for the sliced dataset created by scripts/slice_mimic.py

defaults:
  - mimiciv

# Override data path to point to small dataset
raw_data_path: ./data_small

# More lenient filtering for small dataset
min_los: 1  # Accept stays >= 1 hour (vs 6 hours for full dataset)

# Use all data in the small set (no additional sampling)
debug_table_sample_ratio: 1.0

# Keep debugging mode off for accurate results
# (The small dataset size itself provides the speedup)
